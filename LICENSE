I've deliberately used a permissive MIT License to encourage broad adoption of more 
sustainable icons everywhere. While not required under the MIT License, I’d still 
appreciate it if you could kindly credit me when redistributing these icons of 
modifications thereof, and or let me know if you’re redistributing them. To be 
honest, it’ll make me happy just to know more people are eager to rid the internet 
of inefficient icons. Added because of past experience with plagiarists: Obviously, 
you can't claim credit for creating them in the first place. I made them, and it 
took a lot of time and hyperfocus. Reuse, education, and learning from my techniques 
is encouraged. Deceptive behaviour is not.
